I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/), advised by professor [Das-Shik Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nd-UgBYAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). I have primarily researched computer vision in various application domains, including `medical`, `satellite`, and `facial` imaging fields.

Initially, I was interested in practical technologies that could benefit people, but over time, I grew an interest in technologies that not only bring joy to people but also have the potential to fundamentally transform their lives.

My recent research interests lie in `3D vision` and `computer graphics`, including the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). I believe that emerging technologies like NeRF will fundamentally change the way people capture and store time and space.

I am actively conducting research on pivotal technologies for this future, with a keen interest in the editing of 3D spaces and content generation within them. I am particularly interested in topics such as `3D editing`, `3D content generation`, `neural radiance field`, `neural representation`, and their various applications.
